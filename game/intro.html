    <p>Hello! You are on your first day of Code Fellows. You are super excited to be here and are kinda nervous to meet your fellow hackers. As you walk in you are told that you have orientation for your very first day. Anxiously, you take a seat and wait for it to start. At 9:00am, you see Brook stand up and starts smiling and getting pumped up. He starts to blend with the code because he is intune with the code an excited about what he is talking about. You realize that this is the place for you. When Brook finishes, he askes the instructorial team to stand up and talk a little bit about themselfs. You meet your teacher, Mr. Adam Walraff. You realize that Adams beard is awesome and he must be knowledgable because no one can keep a beard like that and not be smart. While in class, you do your introduction and start to get your mind blown.</p>
