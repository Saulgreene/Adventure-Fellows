    <p class="welcome">Hello! You are on your first day of Code Fellows. You are super excited to be here and are kinda nervous to meet your fellow hackers. As you walk in you are told that you have orientation for your very first day. Anxiously, you take a seat and wait for it to start. At 9:00am, you see Brook stand up and start smiling and getting pumped up. He starts to blend with the code because he is in tune with it and excited for you to learn. You realize that this is the place for you. When Brook finishes, he askes the instructional team to stand up and talk a little bit about themselves. You meet your teacher, Mr. Adam Walraff. You realize that Adam's beard is awesome and he <em>must</em> be knowledgable because no one can keep a beard like that and <em>not</em> be smart! While in class, you do your introduction and prepare to get your mind blown.</p>
