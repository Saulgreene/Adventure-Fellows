#User Stories:
* As a user I want to have a way of keeping track of my score in some sort of leaderboard, so that it keeps the game competitive and less boring.
* As a user I would like to make choices, so that I feel my decisions make a difference in the outcome of the game.
* As a developer I want to have a fluid transition from the start page to the character selection page and from the character selection to the game, so that the user experience is smooth and enjoyable.
* As a employer I would like to organize my files in a meaningful way, so I can have an easier time looking through and using the product that we created.
* As a user I would like to have the game be challenging, so it doesn't get boring as quickly and has more content.
