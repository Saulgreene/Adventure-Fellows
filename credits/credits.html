        <p>Allie is originally from Cleveland, Ohio. By default, she is a Browns fan, which is a tough life to lead but she does it with passion. She started learning the basics of coding while working for a wedding website called Joy and that sparked her interest in computer programming and led her to Code Fellows! Since moving to Seattle, she has spent a lot of time hiking and snowboarding. She is always on the hunt for the perfect sushi, perfect pizza, and perfect chocolate chip cookie. One of her favorite Seattle activities is walking around Pike Place Market while eating mini maple bacon donuts from Daily Dozen.</p>

        <p>The reason I started looking into coding is I knew I wanted to to upgrade my life and do something I really enjoyed. I knew that I was not doing well as a mechanic and I hated always being disgusting and going home after work bruised and battered. I was told by my fiance's dad about Code Fellows and I am so glad and excited to be able to do this. I am a passionate reader with no care which type as long as it keeps my attention. Enjoys playing a well thought out video game and loves to read and watch videos that coincided with said video game. While in the military I was enjoying the life of adventure but was cut short by Crohnâ€™s Disease and was medically retired. I miss the camaraderie and brotherhood that came along with the military and heard that it was the same in the coding world. </p>
